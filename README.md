# Memory Game 
This HTML/JS/CSS where the player tries to find all the pairs by clicking on
two cards and seeing if they match. It also features sounds with a best time
after the game is completed.

## More Information
This project was written to teach a class of children about what programming
could allow them them to do. The class initially started with the children playing the memory game with physical cards then having the children discuss 
and customize the software version of the memory game with the teacher (me)
going through the various features in a step-by-step manner. Once the software
game was completed, it was uploaded to a public website and the children used
cellphones to play the game with prizes for completing the game as well as special prizes for the best 3 times.

## Tech/Framework Used
* HTML/JS/CSS
